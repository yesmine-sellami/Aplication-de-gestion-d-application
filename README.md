Welcome to the Visitor Management Application repository. This project aims to streamline visitor registration and access control at Sopal. The application allows reception staff to easily record visitor information and grant access via a turnstile with just a click. It features a visitor history page for tracking current entries and an intuitive filtering system to review visitor details by selected dates. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery for the frontend, and ASP.NET Core MVC with SQL Server for the backend, this application ensures robust functionality and user-friendly interface design. It leverages modern web technologies to enhance efficiency and security in managing visitor flows within the organization.
